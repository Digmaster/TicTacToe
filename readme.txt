# TicTacToe
TicTacToe with AI

# How to run
Clone this repository or open the zip file, and navigate to this directory in the command prompt and run

cd TicTacToe

````python TicTacToe.py````




# How to play
The first prompt asks for the number of AI agents to play against. The options are as follows:
0: No AI, you and another player will play, alternating turns
1: One AI. The AI will start, and you must play against it
2: Two AI agents will play against each other

To play a move at the prompt, you must give a number between 1 and 9. These correspond to the following tiles

|1|2|3|

|4|5|6|

|7|8|9|

At each turn the chosen tile will be displayed both as a number as well as on a printed out grid and a
visulaized grid. For a single agent game the prompt will wait until the human player inputs a proper number.
At the end of the game the output will specifiy the winner of the game, or indicate a tie if there is no
winner.
